# 8-bit-processor-FPGA-VHDL
This undergraduate thesis aims to create a processor design that is compatible with an 8-bit graphics card.

In this study, relevant information from previous works in the literature regarding the solution of the problem and the methods planned to be used in addressing the problem were brought together within the framework of a concept project and implemented. Utilizing the available resources, a simple processor model was designed using VHDL hardware description language, and hardware design tools were used to perform testing and verification steps, thoroughly examining the operational logic of the microprocessor. Based on the findings obtained, a microprocessor design was developed. Building upon the microprocessor design, a physical graphics processor model was created by incorporating components such as a graphics card, bit counters, NAND and NOT gates, and EEPROM memory onto solderless circuit boards, with the aim of visualizing the processor outputs.

The document of the aforementioned processor design project is located in the "Releases" directory.
